# Group Project Milestones

Use these as the overall milestones you need to reach before Demo Day.

## Milestone 1 - Document Phase

Decide on a series of features the project should have.

Build a One-pager, a Data Model doc, and work up some UX/UI mockup diagrams. The more planning done at this phase to the Data Model, the easier the subsequent phases will be.

What entities will your project manage on behalf of a User entity??

## Milestone 2 - Data Model to JDL

Develop the JDL file to be used with jhipster. Carefully discuss the relationships between the entities.

## Milestone 3 - Create Backend/REST Server

Use Spring Initializr or Jhipster to create a rest server backend in Spring.

Diable the Security beans so you can test the API without having to handle logins and/or JWT-type authorization/access to the data model.

## Milestone 4 - First Front End (FE)

Build a VanillaJS, simple front end to your REST Server. Show some lists of entities and some entity details. Use very simple CSS styling.

Add a simple posting mechanism for some entity.

## Milestone 5 - Front End in React

Either mimic what jhipster is doing for the UX/UI (with login and JWT support; look for current_user in the typescript HTML templates in the JH front end). OR generate a from scratch React UI, that talks to the JH/Spring server/

## Milestone 6 - Get running on Fly.io

Use a service like fly.io to host your project so multiple people can access it at once. This can be very impressive on demo day.

## Milestone 7 - Demo Development

You’ll need to work ups demonstration of your project. The end-goal is to have a very polished, tight, and well-crafted demo showing what your software does. You want to demo for success, and working hard on a demo is great way to show off what you’ve been learning.
